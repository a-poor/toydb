## About

I started writing `ToyDB` as a _toy_ project, in order to get a better sense of
how RDBMSs work.

My goal isn't to write a high-performance database or even necessarily to finish
`ToyDB` -- it's to continue to get a better understanding of the inner workings
of a database.

## Installation

`ToyDB` can be installed using PyPi:

```bash
$ pip install toydb
```

## Status

__NOTE: Still in development.__

* Add indexes and keys
* Implement ``ORDER BY``

There currently isn't any functionality for ``JOIN``s or ``GROUP BY``s.

## Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on `ToyDB`.
