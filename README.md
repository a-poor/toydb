## About

I started writing `ToyDB` as a _toy_ project, in order to get a better sense of
how RDBMSs work.

My goal isn't to write a high-performance database or even necessarily to finish
`ToyDB` -- it's to continue to get a better understanding of the inner workings
of a database.

## Installation

`ToyDB` can be installed using PyPi:

```bash
$ pip install toydb
```

## Status

__NOTE: Still in development.__

- [x] Write the framework
- [x] Layout the DB directory structure and file format
- [ ] Write a SQL parser
- [ ] Write a query function
- [ ] Table Join functionality

## Feedback

I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on `ToyDB`.
